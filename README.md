# Factorial-Calculation
Calculator to calculate factorial and to find possibilities
This is nothing but a simple science expiriment, what this program will do is calculate the factorial of 10,000 and will add 10,000 every single round and display the time it took to do so, the exponent in scientific notation. I will add this all to a graph and find a pattern, if anyone can find an accurate pattern Good for you.
